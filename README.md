# AutoAnki
Auto-Generate Anki Flashcards from a text file.
 
Converts Chinese books from text files to Anki decks.

![Text to Anki](media/images/example.jpg "Text to Anki")

AutoAnki was created to help Chinese learners get into more advanced texts. 
It can be hard transitioning from graded readers to full books, and this tool was designed to help ease that process.

## Usage

AutoAnki is both a library and a terminal tool. 
To get started, run 
```pip install auto-anki```
This should install all the requirements. Then, in a Python file do```from AutoAnki import AutoAnki, cli```

To get started, first, create a database for AutoAnki to use 
```    
db_path = "AutoAnki.db"
if not AutoAnki.is_database(db_path):
    AutoAnki.create_autoanki_db(db_path)
```
Then create an instance of AutoAnki using the database
```
aa = AutoAnki(db_path)
```
Add whatever books you want in your deck. These can be text files, or a folder full of text files
```
bookpath = 'short-story.txt'
aa.add_book(bookpath, 'My first booküòÜ')
```
Once all of your books are added, the definitions need to be found, and then you can create a deck!
```
aa.complete_unfinished_definitions()
aa.create_deck("AutoAnki Deck", "output")
```
This will automatically have the .apkg extension, which Anki uses. Go into Anki, and import this file. You should see your deck in the list 

When getting definitions for words, it uses selenium to scrape definitions
from a dictionary website
Check your version of Chrome, and put the same version driver in the same directory as main.

### Terminal
If you would like to run AutoAnki from the terminal, run AutoAnki/terminal.py  
This will run a terminal interface where you will be able to run
## Files
See `code_outline.md` for more info on the files and how they are used.
## Planned features
- Currently, all definitions are collected from the internet. This is really slow, 
so using a dictionary from a file would greatly improve performance. It could fall back on the 
web dictionary for words it can't find
- More customization for how the cards in the deck look, and what they have on them
- The ability to hear what a word sounds like. The database supports this, I just need combine the sounds, and upload the sounds with the cards.
